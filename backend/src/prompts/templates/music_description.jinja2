Write a brief, engaging introduction for a classical music piece that a radio host would read before playing it. Keep it to 2-3 sentences.

Title: {{ title }}
Composer: {{ composer }}

Include one or two interesting facts about the piece or composer. Make it conversational and suitable for a morning radio show. Do not include any prefixes like "Here's" or "And now" - just the interesting content.
